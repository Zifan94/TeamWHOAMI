      <t>PEEP (Players Enjoy Eavesdropping Protocol) is a “middleware” protocol intended to provide reliable transmission
        between two communicating applications. The protocol is composed of three process: three-way handshake, data
        transmission and four-way termination. This document describes the functions to be performed by the PEEP layer
        and the program that implements it.</t>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>The purpose of lab 2 is to design and implement a TCP-like transport layer to be used by application-layer protocols.
      This layer connects to the layers used in the PLAYGROUND framework, designed by Dr. Seth James Nielson, to allow students
      an environment to learn about internet security attacks and defenses on a much smaller scale.</t>

      <t>In particular, the transport layer in lab 2, dubbed PEEP (Players Enjoy Eavesdropping Protocol) consists of the
        following parts: a 3-way handshake to establish connection between a server side application and a client side
        application, data transmission between protocols, and a 4-way termination. Although there were multiple teams each working
        on an implementation on such a layer, the class as a whole was required to use the same general design so that every layer
        would work on the same PLAYGROUND framework. To accomplish this, each team elected one member to participate in a PETF
        (Playground Engineering Task Force) to formulate a communal design for the layer, including the expectations of the 3-way
        handshake, data transmission, and 4-way termination, along with clear acceptance criteria of a PEEP packet and a state machine
        for the protocols. This PLAYGROUND RFC, or PRFC, will go into more depth of each of these aspects that the PETF agreed on as
        well as how our team, WHOAMI, handled error cases and unit testing.</t>
